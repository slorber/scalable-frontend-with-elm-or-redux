This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project is an example usage of [modux-js](https://github.com/PCreations/modux-js) micro framework to create modular, fractable redux apps.

It was created in response to the [Scalable frontend, with Elm or Redux](https://github.com/slorber/scalable-frontend-with-elm-or-redux) challenge by [Sébastien Lorber](https://github.com/slorber). All kudos to him to get me scratch my head very hard on this !
